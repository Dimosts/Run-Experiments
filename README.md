# RunExp
**Warning** This repository is still experimental and does not provide ANY guarantees or warranty!!

This repository contains the code for the `runexp`, a Python tool to ease running Python-coded experiments.

Highlight features include:
- Clear filestructure
  - Including support for json and pickle files
- Easy paralellization of experiments
- Data loading tools for processing experiment results
- [Anything you put in a pull request :)]

## How to install?
The easiest way to use the repository is to download/clone the repo and install the package in "editable" mode:
```batch
$ pip install -e runexp
```

## How to use?
To use the `runexp` framework for running your experiments, you will need the following:

 - A main experiment function to call
 - A config file defining parameters and values for the above function
 - A subclass of the `Runner` class defining mapping from string-arguments to Python objects
 - A output directory to store results of your experiments

For each experiment, `runexp` will create a new directory in the `results` directory containing all artifacts of you experiment.

Below, we go into detail of each of the components by using the `example/...` folder as a running example

To run the example, run the following commands:

```batch
$ cd example
$ python3 main.py sample_config.json my_cool_experiment MyRunner results --unravel --parallel
```
The above example requires some argument parsing from the command line.
A default parser can be imported: `from runexp import default_parser`.
This parser will use the `argparse` library to parse some frequently used arguments.

```bash
$ python3 main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [-u] [--parallel] [--num-workers NUM_WORKERS] config func runner output

positional arguments:
  config                Configuration file, should be json-formatted
  func                  Main function of the experiment
  runner                runexp Runner subclass to call
  output                Directory to output results of experiments

options:
  -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
  -u, --unravel               Whether to unravel config file to run experiments in a batch (will unravel lists in configuration file to separate configs)
  --parallel                  Wheter to run experiments in paralell, only useful if `--unravel` is True
  --num-workers NUM_WORKERS   Number of threads to use for parallelization (=nb of experiments running in parallel, default=11
  --memory MEMORY             Memory limit in MB to use by each experiment, only works on Linux.
```

If the experiment runs out of memory, it will generate a `err.txt` file containing the stringified error, instead of the artifacts expected from the experiment. 

### Experiment function
The main function of your experiment should take as input parameters defined in your configuration file.
The output of this function should be a dictionary. 
Each of the keys in this dictionary will be the filename of the artifact of the experiment.
Based on the type of artifact, the way `runexp` stores the value will be different:
1) If the artifact is human-readable (i.e., if it is an integer/string) the value will be put in a `.txt` file.
2) If the artifact is a list/set/tuple of human-readable values, each of the values will be put on a new line in a `.lst` file. 
3) If the artifact is a dictionary containing only human-readable values, the artifact will be written as a `.json` file.
4) In all other cases, the value will be "pickled" and stored as a binary `.pickle` file.

For an example experiment function, take a look at the `example/experiment.py` file.
This experiment takes as input a data wrapper and a string.
The output of the experiment is an instance of a `HandyDataWrapper` object and a randomly shuffled version of the string it got as input argument.

### Config file
`runexp` uses `.json` based configuration files to define the parameters for your experiments.

If the optional argument `unravel` is set when calling `runexp`, the configuration file will be unraveled, essentially creating a batch of experiments.
I.e., if any of the values in the configuration file is a list, the contents of the remaining configuration will be replicated ones for each of the values in the list.
In `example/sample_config.json` this feature is used for `v2` of `arg1`.

`runexp` also allows you to define a range of values in the configuration file by using the special keys `_from` and `_to`.
This is identical to using `range(_from, _to)` in Python.
In `example/sample_config.json` this feature is highlighted in the `seed` parameter.

When the `--unravel` argument is set, the `sample_config.json` will be unraveled to 10 configuration files for running 10 experiments.

`runexp` has special support for convering values to timestamps or timedelta's.
For this, it relies on the Pandas library for converting strings to `pd.Timestamp` or `pandas.Timedelta` objects.
To automatically convert a string to a timestamp, it's key in the config file should end with "_dt".
Similarly, to convert to a timedelta, it should end with "_td".

The library also supports expanding ranges of time-delta's with a given step.
For example, the following configuration:
```json
{
  "x_dt": {"_from": "2025-01-01", "_to": "2025-02-01", "_step": "1 day"}
}
```
will be unraveled to the following 31 experiment configs:

```python
{'x_dt': {'start': pandas.Timestamp('2025-01-02 00:00:00'), 'delta': pandas.Timedelta('1 days 00:00:00')}}
{'x_dt': {'start': pandas.Timestamp('2025-01-03 00:00:00'), 'delta': pandas.Timedelta('1 days 00:00:00')}}
...
{'x_dt': {'start': pandas.Timestamp('2025-01-30 00:00:00'), 'delta': pandas.Timedelta('1 days 00:00:00')}}
{'x_dt': {'start': pandas.Timestamp('2025-01-31 00:00:00'), 'delta': pandas.Timedelta('1 days 00:00:00')}}
````
where "start" and "delta" are keys inserted by `runexp`.


### Runner subclass
The `Runner` class is the heart of `runexp` where the magic happens.
In order to tailor the repository to work with your experiment, it suffices to fill in the `make_kwargs` function.
This function will take as input one (unraveled) configuration as a dictionary and aims to map the string-based arguments to actual Python objects.
The output of this function should be a dictionary containing all arguments to the `Experiment function` as keys.

In `example/main.py` you can find an example `Runner` class converting `arg1` in the configuration to a `HandyDataWrapper` instance.
Note that the JSON library used for loading configuration files automatically interprets strings, floats and ints from the json file.

#### Optional for pretty progress
`runexp` uses the `tqdm` library to track progress of your experiments.
To get some detailed information, you can override the `description(config)` function to return a more informative description of the experiment that is currently running.
Examples the particular problem instance you are running an experiment with in combination with a random seed.

### Output directory
`runexp` will create a results directory for each finished expeirment within the `output_dir`.
If `output_dir` already exists and contains some finished experiments already, `runexp` will scan those results and check if there is overlap with the currently planned experiments.
When this is the case, the already ran experiments will be skipped and not executed again.

The names given to each exeriment folder is a integer with leading zeros. The default setting uses 6 digits, allowing for 999.999 experiments in one folder.
This can be changed by setting the `digits` attribute in your `Runner` instance.

## Processing results

After running the experiments, `runexp` provides some utility function to ease the loading of results.
In particular, the `utils.results_to_df` function is interesting.
It takes as argument a main directory name (the parent dir of all `0000001`, `0000002`,... files) and a list of attrbibutes to load.
This function will read each `config.json` file and transform the (nested) keys to a string, used as a column name in the resulting dataframe.
The resulting dataframe can easily be used for further processing/plotting the results, as shown in [example/plot_results.ipynb](https://github.com/IgnaceBleukx/Run-Experiments/blob/main/example/plot_results.ipynb)

# FAQ

I get the following error:

```
NameError: name 'my_cool_experiment' is not defined
```
**Fix**: Make sure `my_cool_experiment` is imported where the `Runner` instance is initialized.
